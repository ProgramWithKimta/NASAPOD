## Description
Project 3 is to build a full stack website that usings web APIs, JWT, PostgresSQL, Express, Apollo Server, and GraphQL. We decided to use the NASA API. When you land on the app, it will ask you to log in or register. Once you're logged in, you will be directed to the home page where it will display the 'picture of the day'. The app has other options such as viewing a random photo, but selecting a random photo generator button, a calendar option where you can pick a specific date, a seven day gallery where you can view the photos from the past 7 days, and a favorite gallery that shows you all the liked photos.
